	<p><i>"Setup consists of determining order of play, issuing armies to players, and allocating the territories on the board among players, who place one or more armies on each one they own.
Example of matching up attacking (red) and defending (white) dice; in this dice roll, the defender loses two armies.

At the beginning of his turn, a player receives reinforcement armies proportional to the number of territories held, bonus armies for holding whole continents, and additional armies for turning in matched sets of territory cards (cards are marked with a match symbol analogous to the suit of a playing card) obtained by conquering new territories. In a player's turn, he may attack, move his armies, or pass. A player may attack across a boundary of any of his territories where he faces an opposing army; some "boundaries" are marked by sea-lanes on the board. Attacks are decided by dice rolls, with the attacker or defender losing a specified number of armies per roll. Battles may go to completion, i.e. one player or the other loses all of his armies at that site, or stop at any point. If the defenders loses all his armies at that site, the attacker takes over his old territory by moving armies onto it, and draws a territory card for that turn. If the defender has no armies left on the board, he is eliminated from the game, and the attacker acquires any territory cards he owns. The player may launch additional attacks or stop at any time. At the end of his turn, a player may move armies from one of his territories to another adjacent territory.

The game ends when one player owns all the territories, i.e. he is the only player left."</i><p>
