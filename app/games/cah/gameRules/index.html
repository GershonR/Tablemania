	<p><i>All players maintain a hand of 10 white cards, which serve as answers to black cards. Each round one player serves as the judge- they read a black card and receive white cards as answers.  The judge then awards the black card as a point to the owner of the chosen white card. The judge rotates clockwise around the circle until people get bored. </i></p>
