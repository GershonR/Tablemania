To run application:
Run a command-line
CD into the directory containing chrome.exe
Close all running Chrome sessions
Execute "chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files"

If issues persist with Chrome (infinite loading spinner), using the lastest 
version of Firefox should remedy the issue.

Alternatively, the prototype can also be viewed
online at gersh.in/HCI
